1. Introduction to Python Programming: Setting the stage with a foundational overview is essential, offering a starting point for learners unfamiliar with Python.

2. Programming Rules: Understanding the fundamental rules of programming in Python helps lay down the groundwork for structuring and organizing code.

3. Constants & Variables: Essential for understanding the basics of Python's data storage and manipulation.

4. Pseudo Code: A great introduction to planning and outlining logic before diving into the coding phase.

5. Types of Operators: Vital for carrying out operations in Python. Covering arithmetic, comparison, logical, and other operators can facilitate learners in performing various tasks.

6. Conditional Statements: Introduces decision-making within code, a core concept in programming. This includes if, else, and elif constructs.

7. Loops: Covering for and while loops, including nested loops, enables learners to iterate through data efficiently.

8. Data Types: Understanding different data types (integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc.) is fundamental for data manipulation and analysis.

9. Type Casting: Knowledge about converting one data type to another is vital in Python programming.

10. String Handling: Fundamental for data processing, as text data is prevalent in data science.

11. Error Handling: Understanding and managing errors is crucial for writing robust and error-free code.

12. Functions (Data Structure Using Functions): Introducing functions and how they can be used to structure and organize code, possibly covering how they interact with data structures commonly used in data science tasks.
